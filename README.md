# Hazard Report


## About the Report 

Due to past work experience, I am privy to the level of risks encountered in the Oil and Gas sector. 
This report discusses the potential hazards experirence in the various fields and the relationship 
with reduced Accident rates.

### Methodology 
The project was grouped into 3 main parts to clarify workflow. 

* **Webscraping:** I created a notebook ([Fatal_events](https://github.com/toyinolape/Hazard_Report/blob/master/Fatal_Events.ipynb) & [Near_miss](https://github.com/toyinolape/Hazard_Report/blob/master/Near_miss.ipynb))that parsed and scraped a petroleum accident website in order to collect the data required for my report. 
* **Data Visualization:** Using Power BI I conveyed important information like countries with the most fatalities, the most common cause of accidents and the relationship between hazard reporting and accident rates 
* **Documentation:** Finally I created a short article explaining my view point on hazard reporting.
