# Hazard Report

A hazard is defined as “an unsafe condition or practice that could result in an injury, illness, or damage to property or the environment”. Hazard reporting is an important part of enivronment, safety and health monitoring, and is necessary to prevent accidents and control losses.

Accident prevention is a large part of safety it is essential to ensure that all hazards are identified, addressed and accidents are prevented before they occur.

## About the Report 

Due to past work experience, I am privy to the level of risks encountered in the Oil and Gas sector. 
This report discusses the potential hazards experirence in the various fields and the relationship 
with reduced Accident rates.

### Methodology 
The project was grouped into 3 main parts to clarify workflow. 

* **Webscraping:** I created a notebook ([Fatal_events](https://github.com/toyinolape/Hazard_Report/blob/master/Fatal_Events.ipynb) & [Near_miss](https://github.com/toyinolape/Hazard_Report/blob/master/Near_miss.ipynb))that parsed and scraped a petroleum accident website in order to collect the data required for my report. 
* **Data Visualization:** Using Power BI I conveyed important information like regions with the most fatalities, the most common cause of accidents and the relationship between hazard reporting and accident rates.
* **Documentation:** Finally I created a brief [article](https://github.com/toyinolape/Hazard_Report/blob/master/Article.pdf) on the subject.
